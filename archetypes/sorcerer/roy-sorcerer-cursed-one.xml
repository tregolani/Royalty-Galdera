			<p>Some sorcerers may find their awakened magical lineage a blessing, while others may see it as a curse placed upon them. To others, their magical lineage comes from curses. Be it due to a vile act your ancestor committed ages ago, a cursed artifact they took, or the vengeance of their enemy's dying breath, the end result brought you to be a creatures touched with curses and misery. How you handle this power is up to you; do you strive to aid and prevent the spread of curses, or do you wish to invoke your wrath upon the world through hexes and maledictions?</p>

When another creature you can see within 60 feet of you is about to roll a d20 with disadvantage, you can use your reaction to instead have them roll with advantage. Doing so causes you to gain an amount of temporary hit points equal to 1d6 + your sorcerer level, but your next d20 roll is rolled with disadvantage.</p>
		<p class="indent">While you have disadvantage in this way, you can't use this feature again until you roll a d20 roll, nor can you negate this disadvantage with advantage.</p>
