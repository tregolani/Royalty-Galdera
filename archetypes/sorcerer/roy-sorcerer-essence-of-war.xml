			<p>Your lineage is one of bloodshed, combat, and conquest. Wherever you go, death and conflict follows, or perhaps you use your bloodline to hunt down those who seek senseless conflict. Perhaps you were born on the battlefield, a descendant of a great berserker or general, or you were the gift from a god of war to its devotees. No matter the ancestry, you are a living embodiment of combat.</p>

			<li>They treat this weapon as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.</li>
