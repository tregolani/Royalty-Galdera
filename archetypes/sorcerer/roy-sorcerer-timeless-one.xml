			<p>You are a creature of the past, present, and future. With magic that can shift the sands of time, you have a powerful control over your own fate. You might be a living time paradox, a creature born into the far flung future or the lost past, or a being born old that has been growing younger ever since. Whatever the case may be, the future is for you the shape to your liking.</p>
