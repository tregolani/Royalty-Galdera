			<p>Your glowing blood is tied to the bright beacons from the north and south. Perhaps you were born upon the coldest of nights the world has seen in centuries, perhaps you come from a family with a lineage of worshiping the auroras, or perhaps you were born with a heart of magical ice rather than one of flesh. Sorcerers who use such powers for good are perfect creatures against the forces of fire and darkness. Others are known as "Will o Wisps" due to their charming and bright appearances, only to lead others to a frigid death.</p>

On a failure, a creature is chilled to the bone, and their movement speed is halved until the end of your next turn.</p>

			<p class="indent">You can also use your bonus action to become a living aspect of the northern and southern lights. For the next minute, you emit bright light in a 15-foot radius, and dim light for an additional 15 feet. Friendly creatures gain the following benefits while inside these lights:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>They gain resistance to cold damage.</li>
				<li>They have advantage on the first attack roll they make on each of their turns.</li>
				<li>They have advantage on saving throws against being blinded or having their movement speed reduced.</li>
				<li>They gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed and can hover. This flight only works within the lighted area, and creatures flying in this way fall if they leave the area.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Once you have used this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest, or until you spend 5 sorcery points to regain a use.</p>
